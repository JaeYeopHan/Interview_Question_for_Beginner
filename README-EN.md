# What is this?

It is a repository of materials for prospective developers or developers for technical interview preparation. It didn't cover all areas of development. I would appreciate it as a guideline. Also, I personally prepared the interview so that there may be something wrong. I would be very grateful if you could participate in these parts as `Pull Request` or` Issue`. It is also possible to add good references to the topic. Please post any questions you have while learning from the Repository!
